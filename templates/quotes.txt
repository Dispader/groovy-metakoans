To a mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders.
The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.
One who conquers himself is greater than another who conquers a thousand times a thousand on the battlefield.
When you seek it, you cannot find it.
From the withered tree, a flower blooms
Those who know don't tell and those who tell don't know.
Before enlightenment; chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment; chop wood, carry water.
The infinite is in the finite of every instant.
Sitting quietly, doing nothing, spring comes, and the grass grows by itself.
Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy.
If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.
